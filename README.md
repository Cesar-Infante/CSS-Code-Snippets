# Mini-Project-CSS

For this mini-project, The challenge was to build out a webpage holding a collection of CSS snippets. The best way to actively learn CSS is by implementing it into a project, breaking things, and coming back with a functional working product. By creating a responsive grid, you can view this application on a mobile device as well as a desktop; we can also have a collection of CSS snippets that can be identified by their headings. A user has the ability to highlight code snippets by clicking on them allowing you to try them out for yourself.
